## Overview

    - Alzheimer Disease (AD) is Neurodegenerative disease which has a distinctly complex and perplexing pathology
    - A current hallmark biomarker of Alzheimers is the quantification of amyloid-β and tau proteins
    - To quantify these protiens for a diagnosis a Positron emission tomography (PET) is used to asses the AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid
    - PET Scans are expensive, require expert analysis and also subject the patients to radioactivity, as well as lumbar punctures which result in back pain and bleeding
    - An alternative biomarker currently used for the diagnosis of AD is MRI imaging of the cerebral atrophy, a new key characteristic in AD Neurodegenration
    - Signs of cerebral atrophy can be used to diagnose AD earlier and aid in the course of treatment plans for the patients.  
    - There are issues with MRI detection
        - Requires expert analysis
        - very hard to visually detect small changes in tissue degeneration
        - atrophy may occur long before observable symptons like dementia
    - ML can be used to create a classifying model for early AD detection
    - An accurate ML assisted diagnosis can reduce expense, aid in treatment plans and also offer research insight into the pathology of AD
    - In this project we use a Kaggle Alzheimers image data set to train a model that can accuratly classify MRI images of patients with No Dementia, very mild Dementia, mild Dementia and Moderate Dementia
    - Our goal is that our model can be used as a preliminary diagnosis tool to 




## Bussiness Problem 
    - Current methods for diagnosing Alzheimers disease in patients displaying early signs of dementia are expensive, risky and require expert analysis.  Recent studies have shown that using MRI imaging to visualize neurodegeneration can be an alternative method of diagnosis.  While this method decreases expense and risk, MRI imaging for tissue atrophy still requires visual analysis, resulting in potential human error.  Using machine learning algorithms we plan on creating a classifying model that can be used to classify the progression of demensia in AD patients and be used as a primary diagnostic tool for further medical intervention.  In this project we aim to answer the following questions:
        - What are some of the distinct features of the four classes of dementia?
        - Can we create a model that accuratly classifies AD MRI images?
        - What model and method best reduces the number of false positive when classifying images>


## Data
    - The data was collected from a kaggle database which was a selection of brian MRI images collected from various websites
    - [Kaggle data set]('https://www.kaggle.com/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images')
    - The dataset consists of one train and one test folder, each with images labled with four different stages of AD symptom progression
        - NonDemented    
        - Very Mild Demented
        - Mild Demented
        - Moderate Demented
