## Overview

    - Alzheimer Disease (AD) is Neurodegenerative disease which has a distinctly complex and perplexing pathology
    - A current hallmark biomarker of Alzheimers is the quantification of amyloid-β and tau proteins
    - To quantify these protiens for a diagnosis a Positron emission tomography (PET) is used to asses the AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid
    - PET Scans are expensive, require expert analysis and also subject the patients to radioactivity, as well as lumbar punctures which result in back pain and bleeding
    - An alternative biomarker currently used for the diagnosis of AD is MRI imaging of the cerebral atrophy, a new key characteristic in AD Neurodegenration
    - Signs of cerebral atrophy can be used to diagnose AD earlier and aid in the course of treatment plans for the patients.  
    - There are issues with MRI detection
        - Requires expert analysis
        - very hard to visually detect small changes in tissue degeneration
        - atrophy may occur long before observable symptons like dementia
    - ML can be used to create a classifying model for early AD detection
    - An accurate ML assisted diagnosis can reduce expense, aid in treatment plans and also offer research insight into the pathology of AD
    - In this project we use a Kaggle Alzheimers image data set to train a model that can accuratly classify MRI images of patients with No Dementia, very mild Dementia, mild Dementia and Moderate Dementia
    - Our goal is that our model can be used as a preliminary diagnosis tool to
